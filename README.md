Mood Lamp with Fan

This project is a mood lamp that rotates through the spectrum of green, blue and red. the changes to this project are the added formatting
to the changing light and the delay of this changing light. the other changes is a fan to turn on various speeds when it hits certain 
intervals of temperature mesasured in celsius. The idea for the project came from the need to have a lamp on my desk that turns on and off 
due to light in the room and with my room being so warm in the summer it will also help control the hheat in the room or at least at the
desk.
