Mood Lamp with RGB and Button 

  This project allows you to have a light trun on by a light sensor and turn off with a button. This will be a small compact desk 
  lamp that will cycle RGB lighting during a low light environment. This lamp is perfect for small areas that need a bright light
  it works well with the cycle of light.

Materials Required

- Arduino Uno
- Jumper wires
- 1 RGB LED or 1 red LED, 1 green LED and 1 blue LED
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- Protoboard (breadboard)
- frosted cup (displace light)
- Push button

Build Instructions
 
 To build the lamp I placed the led inside the cup and attached it to a cover over the arduino and attached the light sensor 
 and button on the same cover. to do the wiring of the lamp please refer to the bread board diagram image (bread board_bb.jpg)
 mention in the files. 
 
Usage 
  
  To use the lamp properly, be sure to calibrate the code ambient light value to what is needed for the environment the lamp will be 
  used in. After uploading the code to the arduino the light should turn on when the light sensor value is reached, and start to cycle.
  once the light starts to cycle it will continue to cycle if there is low enough lighting. you may press the push button and hold for 5 
  seconds and release it to turn off the light, to turn the lamp back on press and hold the button again for 5 seconds and the light 
  should return back on and cycle. 
  
Team
  
  - Spencer Bachynski -- did all the work on the project from building and coding.
  
  - if you are looking to contribute ideas on how to improve on the build and coding some areas that need work is the possibility of
  selecting colours.
